# Smiley Keyboard

Sometimes you don't know which emoticon to send to a friend.  Instead of going through the hard process of picking the right one, why not let your keyboard grind it out for you? That's what *Smiley Keyboard* is for! 

Instead of selecting the emoticon, you simply use a slider to tell the keyboard how happy you are.  Based on your choice, *Smiley Keyboard* will use an advanced algorithm to locate and place the perfect representation of your request.

With the help of *Smiley Keyboard* anyone can send their friends both large and small smiles, all with just the click of a button!
